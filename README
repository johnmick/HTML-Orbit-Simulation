To Calculate Force Between Two Objects, Uses Newton's Law of Gravitation: F = G* ( M * m ) / d  
	F - Force of Attraction
	G - Gravitational Constant
	M - Mass of Earth
	m - Mass of Satellite
	d - Distance between satellite and geocenter of Earth

Known Current Limitations of Simulation :
	- Force is only being calculated between each satellite and the center Earth object.
	- The satellite's do not pull on each other, nor do they pull on the Earth object
	- No collision detection implemented
	- Not accounting for many other forces which may impact a satellite orbiting earth

Possible Future Plans:
  - Color Points on Absolute Velocities As Opposed to Comparing Against Initial Speed - Possible Gradient Solution
	- Remove Points After the Tail Reaches a Certain Length
	- Add real units to the display
	- Provide scaling - zooming in and out - convert physics calcs to pixels
	- Provide a reference of distance - radial grid or perhaps the Moon
